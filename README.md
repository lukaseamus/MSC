# MSC
This repository contains files accompanying the poster "Uniting seagrass conservation and tourism in Mauritius".

**Methods**

`Methods.pdf` explains the methodological procedure required to produce the poster, addressing the development of each of Figures 1–3 individually. All publications referred to herein can be found in `References.pdf`.

**R script**

`MSC.R` contains all necessary R code to perform the combinatorial meta-analysis and plot Figures 1–3.

**Data**

`locations.csv` contains the coordiantes for areas of extraordinary seagrass damage or health around Mauritius. Together with `map.qgz` and several other shapefiles/geopackages (outlined in `Methods.pdf`), this file is required to plot Figure 1.

`loss.csv` contains data that are relevant to the combinatorial meta-analysis of the effect of seagrass loss on ecosystem functions. It is necessary to plot Figure 2 (see `Methods.pdf` for details).

`goods.csv` contains economic data on the private and public costs/benefits of seagrass degradation/conservation underlying Figure 3 (see `Methods.pdf` for details).

`tourists.csv` contains data obtained from a Tripadvisor search (https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Search?q=seagrass&searchSessionId=32082531294ED0F1FC4D9BC4F8CADC561588599236524ssid&searchNearby=false&geo=293816&sid=C69FDCB111BCBCCEE97EC327697218251588599241765&blockRedirect=true). These data highlight tourists' mostly negative perception of seagrass and reveal the rationale behind seagrass meadow dredging.

**References**

`References.pdf` contains all publications that were referred to on the poster and in the methods as well as an additional section with background reading.
